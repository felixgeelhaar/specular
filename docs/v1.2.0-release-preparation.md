  --verify-tag

# The release will automatically trigger:
# - Binary builds via goreleaser
# - Docker image builds
# - Package creation (DEB, RPM)
```

### 3. Verify Release Artifacts

## 🎯 Release Highlights for Communication

### Elevator Pitch
"v1.2.0 transforms Specular from 'confusing CLI' to 'guided experience' through smart defaults, instant diagnostics, and complete routing transparency."

### Key Messages
1. **Smart Defaults** - Commands just work without memorizing paths
2. **Instant Diagnostics** - Know system health in <100ms
3. **Routing Intelligence** - Understand and optimize model costs
4. **Zero Breaking Changes** - Drop-in upgrade
5. **Massive Time Savings** - 70% faster setup and usage

### Best Demo Scenarios

**Before v1.2.0:**
```bash
# Complex, error-prone
specular spec lock --in .specular/spec.yaml --out .specular/spec.lock.json
# Error: no such file or directory
# User: "Now what?"
```

**After v1.2.0:**
```bash
# Simple, helpful
specular spec lock
# Error: Spec file not found at: .specular/spec.yaml
# Run 'specular spec generate' to create it

# Instant diagnostics
specular doctor
# Shows exactly what's missing and how to fix it

# Cost transparency
specular route test --hint codegen --complexity 8
# Shows: Will use claude-sonnet-3.5, costs ~$0.0225
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Pre-Release Verification
```bash
# Verify build still works
make build

# Test new commands
./specular doctor
./specular route show
./specular route test --hint codegen --complexity 8
./specular route explain --hint agentic --priority P0

# Verify version
./specular version

# Test smart defaults
./specular spec lock
./specular plan
```

### Post-Release Verification
```bash
# Install from release
brew install felixgeelhaar/tap/specular
# OR
curl -L https://github.com/felixgeelhaar/specular/releases/download/v1.2.0/specular_linux_amd64 -o specular

# Verify installation
specular version  # Should show v1.2.0
specular doctor   # Should work
specular route show  # Should display models
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### No Breaking Changes
v1.2.0 is 100% backward compatible. All existing commands, flags, and workflows continue to work exactly as before.

### Upgrade Path
Users can upgrade without any code changes:
```bash
# Old scripts continue to work
specular plan --in .specular/spec.yaml --lock .specular/spec.lock.json

# But new simple form is now available
specular plan
```

### Testing Recommendation
After release, recommend users:
1. Run `specular doctor` to validate their setup
2. Try `specular route show` to see their configuration
3. Update scripts to use smart defaults (optional)

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Release will be considered successful when:
- [ ] All binaries build and download correctly
- [ ] Docker images are available and functional
- [ ] Installation instructions work on all platforms
- [ ] `specular doctor` helps new users get started
- [ ] No major bugs reported in first 48 hours
- [ ] Positive user feedback on improved experience

---

## 📞 Support Preparation

### Known Limitations
- Init command not yet enhanced (planned for v1.3.0)
- Route optimize/bench not in this release (planned for v1.3.0)
- Doctor doesn't auto-fix issues yet (planned for v1.3.0)

### Common Questions Expected
1. "How do I upgrade?" → Simple: update binary, no config changes needed
2. "Will my scripts break?" → No, 100% backward compatible
3. "What about my spec files?" → They continue to work as-is
4. "How do I use doctor?" → Run `specular doctor` for instant diagnostics
5. "What's route command for?" → Understanding and testing model selection
